Running
----------

The app relies on the Cocoapods package manager. If you don't have Cocoapods installed, view the documentation [here](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

With Cocoapods installed, run `pod install` inside the project directory to add the necessary pods to the workspace.
